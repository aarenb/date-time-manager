# Info for developers

## To do
- You can find quite a lot of to do's in the code as comments (TODO:), I use the extention "Todo Tree" by Gruntfuggly, which highlights these and also creates lists with all of the to do comments.
- You can also find some bigger to do's and bugs as issues in the repo on github.
